      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Tomato and egg are a beloved combination in general.</p>
      <p>
        For many Chinese people, this dish represents home-cooked comfort food,
        or 家常菜 (jia chang cai). Every family has their own version.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>cooking oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Start by cutting tomatoes into small wedges. Be sure to remove the
          stems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finely chop the scallion. Then crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season
          with ¼ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon white pepper, ½ teaspoon sesame oil,
          and 1 easpoon Shaoxing wine. Beat eggs for a minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat the wok over medium heat until it just starts to smoke. Then
          add 2 tablespoons of oil and immediately add the eggs. Scramble the
          eggs and remove from the wok immediately. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the wok, turn up the heat to high, and
          add the tomatoes and scallions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir-fry for 1 minute, and then add 2 teaspoons sugar, 1/2 teaspoon
          salt(or to taste), and ¼ cup water (if your stove gets very hot and
          liquid tends to cook off very quickly in your wok, add a little more
          water). Add the cooked eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix everything together, cover the wok, and cook for 1-2 minutes,
          until the tomatoes are completely softened. Uncover, and continue to
          stir-fry over high heat until the sauce thickens to your liking. Serve
          with steamed rice or noodles.
